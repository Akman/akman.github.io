Cayman Blog Theme is a clean, responsive blogging theme for Jekyll. It is inspired by the Cayman Theme for Github Pages, which can be greatly used for single projects but not as blogging platform.

This theme has instead all you need to start today blogging with Jekyll, and no effort: pages, posts, few social buttons. Try loading this on mobile too.

Have a look at the Github page for more information.

You find this descriptive text in the `index.md` file, so you can change it, or remove it completely, according to your needs.

## Projects

- [JavaFX application boilerplate project using gradle and maven build tools](/javafx-boilerplate/)
  
  This project aims to cover best practices for JavaFX application development as a whole.
  It provides tool recommendations for linting, testing and packaging.

- [jlink maven plugin](/jlink-maven-plugin/)

  The jlink maven plugin lets you create a custom runtime image with the jlink
  tool introduced in Java 9. The main idea is to avoid being tied to project
  artifacts and allow the user to fully control the process of creating
  an image. However, it is possible, of course, to customize the process
  using project artifacts.

- [jpackage maven plugin](/jpackage-maven-plugin/)

  The jpackage maven plugin lets you create a custom runtime image/installer
  with the jpackage tool introduced in Java 14. The main idea is to avoid being
  tied to project artifacts and allow the user to fully control the process of
  creating an image/installer.
